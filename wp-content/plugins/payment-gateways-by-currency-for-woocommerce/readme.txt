Manage currencies for WooCommerce payment gateways. Beautifully.

== Description ==

**Payment Gateway Currency for WooCommerce** plugin lets you manage currencies for WooCommerce payment gateways. The plugin can work in two modes:

* **Convert currencies** - convert cart currencies and prices by the currency exchange rates.
* **Restrict currencies** - simple mode that lets you set allowed currencies for payment gateways to show up.

### &#9989; Convert Currencies ###

This mode will convert cart currencies and prices by the currency exchange rates based on the selected payment gateway. For example, you can set the order total to be converted to euros (EUR) for the "Direct bank transfer" gateway, and use US dollars (USD) for all your remaining payment gateways.

* Currency exchange rates can be set manually, or updated automatically from the selected server or plugin, for example, from the "European Central Bank (ECB)" server, or from the "WooCommerce Multilingual (WPML)" plugin.
* Shipping, coupons and cart fees conversions are optional.
* Prices can be converted right away on the cart and checkout pages, or only on the "thank you" page and in the final order.
* Optionally show currently used currency conversion rates, converted and unconverted prices on frontend and in emails to your customers.
* And more...

### &#9989; Restrict Currencies ###

This mode lets you set allowed currencies for WooCommerce payment gateways. For example, you can set the "Check payments" gateway to accept US dollars (USD) or euros (EUR) only, so this gateway will be shown on frontend checkout only for the selected currencies. For each payment gateway you can set "Allowed currencies" (i.e., payment gateway will be available ONLY for selected currencies) or "Denied currencies" (i.e., payment gateway will be NOT available for selected currencies) lists. For example, this is useful if you are using some additional currency switcher plugin.

### &#127942; Premium Version ###

The **free version** allows setting currencies for all standard WooCommerce payment gateways, i.e.:

* Direct bank transfer,
* Check payments,
* Cash on delivery (COD),
* PayPal (including [WooCommerce PayPal Payments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-paypal-payments/)).

With the [Pro version](https://wpfactory.com/item/payment-gateways-by-currency-for-woocommerce/) you can set currencies for **any payment gateway**.
